        Graphing Perpendicular Lines
    </h1>
    <p>
        Two lines are called Perpendicular if they intersect to form four 90° angles.

    </p>
    <p>
        When you place these two lines on a coordinate plane, what you find is that the slopes of each line are opposite reciprocals of eachother.<br>
        This will remain true for any two perpendicular lines on the coordinate plane. Their slopes will always be oppposite reciprocals of eachother. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Example: Given the slope of one of the lines, calculate the second line's slope:<br>
        Line 1: slope = 3/2<br>
        Line 2: slope = ?<br>
        The slope of line two is the opposite of line one. Therefore because line one's slope is positive, our other line must have a slope that is negative; like the purple line in the image below. The red line acts like our line 1 because its slope is positive, or uphill.<br>

    <p>
        If two lines are perpendicular, their slopes are opposite reciprocals.<br>
        1. Opposites: one slope is positive uphill slope, the other line is downhill negative slope.<br>
        2. Reciprocals: Switch the denominator and numerator to create two fractions that are reciprocals.

        There is a song you can sing to help you remember the rules of perpendicular lines:

        Rule: All answers must be simplified.
        <hr>
        The final answer from above is the slope of line 1 = 3 (9 ÷ 3), the slope of line 2 = -1/3. (-3/9 ÷ 3). Always simplify your fractions in math. Even if they don't ask you to. Always simplify your fractions, otherwise it will be a wrong answer.
